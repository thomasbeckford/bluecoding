• The page should never reload.
• Provide a form to the user so they can perform a search against the database of GIP via the API.
• Show the results on the thumbnails in a logical way. A great quantity of results must load in a way that
performance is taken into account.
• When you click on the thumbnail, a modal light-box must be displayed that allows the user to navigate
within individuals GIFS as a slideshow. The GIFS on this view must be fully animated.
• Create a user experience design very polished and refined.
Create code in a clean, readable way, allowing normal conventions.
• The objective for you is to create your own lightbox and the slideshow app, without using a predefined
one.
• Develop and test using Chrome/Chromium browser. Your work will be revised with that browser.
• If you have any note or instructions about the exercise, please write them on the README.md
